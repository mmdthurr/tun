** you must check the conf.go context/buildconf.go **  
** there is currently no hinter for bad config **
** check example/config.json **

abstract view of components:

* routers: 
    routers perform routing they act like 
    diffrent workers will do specific task
    based on their types
        
* handlers:
    each time any connection stablished 
    it passed to handler
    handler act as middleware. may upgrade 
    conn sec(tls/utls)  may filter based on addr
    or based on http hostheader. 

* listeners: 
    each listener object assigned 
    specific handler. 

* dialers: 
    dialer object require pool size which is amount of connection initiated by the dialer context

- filter objects will effect in order they are appended to filter list.

- if you want to proceed in list of filter set result tag 
to `next`, it's preserved for this purpose, naming any tag 
to next will result in undefined behaviour. 

- routers and handlers are shared globaly so changing it via 
api or impl may result in global change. 

- smux type handler will result in two tag, **tag** and **tagpool**,  
you may set diffrent listener or addr filter to manage s2s 
connection which will be used for smux stream opener
